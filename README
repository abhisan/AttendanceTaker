This is a slightly modified version of the app (only changed variable names fr better readability) made by Manas in IITG's 2nd hackathon. Here's to OpenSource and many more hackathons to come.

Code compatible with eclipse. Just download to a folder and import into workspace.
The BarcodeScanner apk has to be installed on the Android for the app to function properly.
